# Hi, I'm Charles Aggasid!

I'm currently a Software Developer in training at [Codeup](https://codeup.com/program/full-stack-web-development/). I am currently serving in the Army Reserves as a Finance Technician (2 years) and I was also a  Culinary Sergeant for 6 years. I was a part owner of a small trucking business in San Antonio. It has always been my interest to do Software Development and I’m taking the initiative to pursue it right now given the time and opportunity. My goal is to build a career in tech so I can help my family. I always strive to work hard and learn as much as I can to improve myself.


- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS - Bootstrap, Javascript - jQuery, MySQL, Java,
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Front End Development.
